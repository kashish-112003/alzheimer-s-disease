# ABSTRACT 
Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions worldwide, necessitating early detection for effective intervention. This research presents a web-based system for Alzheimer’s disease detection utilizing deep learning and Streamlit. The system employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on MRI scans to classify patients into different stages of the disease. The interface is built using Streamlit, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for both medical professionals and researchers.In this research, we propose a deep learning-based approach using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify Alzheimer's disease from brain images. The model is trained on a dataset containing MRI or CT scan images categorized into different stages of the disease. The performance of the model is evaluated using accuracy, loss, and AUC metrics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of deep learning in medical image analysis, providing a reliable automated method for Alzheimer's disease detection.

# conclusion
This research demonstrates the successful development of a web-based system for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease using a deep learning approach on MRI data. The integration of a trained CNN model with a user-friendly Streamlit interface and a robust backend database provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding in the diagnostic process. The achieved results will highlight the potential of deep learning in medical imaging and its ability to contribute to more accurate and timely diagnosis. Future work will focus on several key areas for further enhancement. This includes exploring more advanced CNN architectures, such as 3D CNNs, to leverage the volumetric information in MRI scans more effectively. Investigating the use of transfer learning with pre-trained models on larger datasets could also improve the model's performance and generalization capabilities. Furthermore, integrating the system with other clinical data, such as patient demographics and cognitive test scores, could lead to a more comprehensive and accurate diagnostic assessment. Expanding the system to support real-time MRI analysis and exploring cloud-based deployment options for broader accessibility are also potential future directions. Finally, conducting rigorous clinical validation studies with medical professionals will be crucial to assess the system's real-world applicability and impact on patient care.
